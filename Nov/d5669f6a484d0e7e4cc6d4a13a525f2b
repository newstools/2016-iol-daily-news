&#x200B;Convicted racist &#x200B;P&#x200B;enny Sparrow&#x2019;s&#x200B;&#x200B; woes&#x200B; have worsened as she now has to pay the ANC a &#x201C;substantial amount&#x201D; for a failed appeal, party lawyer Peter Williams said on Thursday.Sparrow has &#x200B;already been ordered to pay R150&#x2005;000 to the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation&#x200B;, &#x200B;&#x200B;plus an additional R5&#x2005;000 for her racist slurs earlier this year.Th&#x200B;is after the then DA member took to Facebook after New Year&#x2019;s Day and referred to black people on Durban&#x2019;s packed beaches as &#x201C;monkeys&#x201D; who had no education.The ANC lodged a hate speech complaint against Sparrow, and she was subsequently axed from the DA before being&#x200B; convicted&#x200B; in the Equality Court.On June 10&#x200B;, magistrate Irfaan Khallil found the former estate agent&#x2019;s words constituted hate speech and a serious affront to the human dignity&#x200B; of ANC members and&#x200B;&#x200B; &#x200B;of black&#x200B; people.In her Facebook post, Sparrow wrote: &#x201C;These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year&#x2019;s Eve and New Year&#x2019;s Day on to public beaches, towns, etc, obviously have no education whatsoever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don&#x2019;t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statues and get their way. Oh dear.&#x201C;From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter (sic).&#x201D;Khalli ordered Sparrow to apologise and to pay R150&#x2005;000&#x200B;&#x200B; to the &#x200B;foundation.The magistrate also ordered the case be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for its &#x201C;consideration regarding the institution of criminal proceedings&#x201D;.On July 4, Sparrow filed an application to appeal against the Equality Court judgment, but Khallil found the application contained several deficiencies.In the criminal case which followed on September 12, a plea and sentencing agreement was reached with the State.Sparrow was found guilty of crimen injuria and sentenced to a fine of R5&#x2005;000 or 12 months&#x2019; imprisonment. She was also sentenced to two years&#x2019; imprisonment suspended for five years.After she appealed against the Equality Court ruling, lawyers for the ANC personally served a notice on Sparrow in which they notified her that her application for leave to appeal did not comply with the rules of court&#x200B;, said Williams&#x200B;.&#x200B;&#x201C;We afforded her 10 court days in which to rectify it, but she failed to do so.&#x200B;&#x201D;The ANC moved to have the application set aside as an irregular step in terms of &#x201C;rules of court&#x201D;.Sparrow appeared in court on Thursday accompanied by her daughter, Charmaine Cowie, said Williams&#x200B;.&#x201C;Ms Sparrow&#x2019;s application does not comply with the rules of court in that she has not stipulated a service address for the service of documents. It is therefore difficult to serve documents on her personally.&#x201C;Secondly, an aggrieved person should lodge an appeal in the high court. Because Ms Sparrow filed her application in the Magistrate&#x2019;s Court, the court did not have the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the matter,&#x201D; he said.Williams said the notice of appeal must be delivered to the registrar and complainant within 14 days of the order made.&#x201C;Ms Sparrow&#x2019;s notice was delivered outside this time period,&#x201D; he said.The notice of appeal must also set out the order against which the appeal is directed and the grounds on which it is founded, he said.&#x201C;Ms Sparrow&#x2019;s notice of appeal did not comply with this requirement.&#x201D;&#x200B;Williams said&#x200B; Khallil asked Sparrow if she &#x200B;was to oppose the ANC&#x2019;s application to have her notice set aside, and she then opted to withdraw her application to appeal.Khallil ruled the ANC &#x200B;was &#x201C;substantially successful in its application&#x201D;. He declared Sparrow&#x2019;s application an irregular step and set it aside&#x200B;, said Williams&#x200B;.Sparrow was also ordered to pay the ANC&#x2019;s legal costs, which Williams could not &#x200B;quantify on Thursday, but said &#x200B;it would be &#x201C;substantial&#x201D;.Williams said the ANC &#x200B;was &#x201C;&#x200B;extremely pleased&#x201D;&#x200B; with the ruling.&#x201C;People should be careful what they post on Facebook, as ill-considered posts can have severe consequences. Incidences such as this constitute a serious affront to the human dignity of black people and it impedes the building of a non-racial society,&#x201D; he said.
