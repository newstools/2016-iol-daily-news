The ball was now in the ANC&#x2019;s court for it to decide to either ditch President Jacob Zuma or suffer the adverse effects of his actions, United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa warned on Wednesday.He was commenting on former public protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s state capture report, especially on its recommendation that a judicial commission of inquiry be set up to investigate serious breaches of the law, allegedly committed by state entities and some cabinet ministers in their relationship with the Guptas.Madonsela&#x2019;s findings also fingered Zuma in that the executive, which he leads, had failed to take action.Holomisa said: &#x201C;The remedial action proposed by the public protector is going to linger on the head of the ANC and Zuma.&#x201C;If it doesn&#x2019;t take action, its already battered image would suffer a more serious knock. It&#x2019;s going to hit hard on the ANC.&#x201D;He said it was important for the ANC not to delay in making a pronouncement.Holomisa welcomed that there would be a forensic investigation, saying that would enable investigators to dig further into areas where Madonsela failed because of the lack of funds to investigate during her time in office.&#x201C;Zuma will not be able to play delaying tactics if a forensic investigation is conducted.&#x201C;They will ask simply: When did you meet the Guptas? He will have to answer that question, and many more.&#x201D;Most of the opposition parties welcomed Madonsela&#x2019;s call for remedial action.African Christian Democratic Party leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe endorsed the view that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng should appoint the commission of inquiry judge and that the findings be presented within 80 days.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said his party was going to ensure the inquiry&#x2019;s remedial action was implemented.&#x201C;We are going to follow every process to ensure that Zuma falls,&#x201D; he said.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the party would study the report before it would comment.ANC Women&#x2019;s League&#x2019;s secretary-general Meokgo Matuba cast doubt on the report.&#x201C;The ANCWL has taken into account that any person or institution implicated has the right to take the report for judicial review if deemed necessary.&#x201C;Those rights must be respected by the law-abiding citizens of South Africa.&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a need for a full investigation on state capture.&#x201C;Any investigation which excludes white monopoly capital is an advancement of white supremacy and serves a racial political agenda that hinders the building of a non-racial society,&#x201D; she said.
