Pietermaritzburg - Finally, it seems the trial of seven men charged with kidnapping an Underberg businessman may begin, after three years of delays.Previous delays revolved around the issue of securing a Punjabi interpreter for three of the accused. Other interpreters required are Urdu, Gujurati and isiZulu.On Wednesday, Pietermaritzburg Regional Court prosecutor Ricky van Wyk confirmed that the state had secured a Punjabi interpreter who speaks the Pakistan dialect.This comes on the back of warnings by the defence that they would be applying for a permanent stay of prosecution, or provisional withdrawal of charges if any further delays cropped up.But Van Wyk assured that the State was ready for trial and the matter was adjourned to November 27.Five Pakistani nationals and two KwaZulu-Natal policemen are charged with the kidnapping of Pakistani national Mohsin Patel.The case first came to court in 2013, when the seven accused first appeared, charged in connection with the alleged abduction of Patel, who was held in captivity for 22 days by alleged business rivals.Patel was found chained to a bed in a Shelly Beach house on July 23, 2013, where he was allegedly tortur&#xAD;ed, starved and threatened with death.Kidnappers allegedly contacted his father in India demanding R1 million for his release. Jasandra Supal and Sizwe Mkhize are on bail of R1 000 each.Their Pakistani co-accused remain in custody.
