Sporting icon Neil Tovey on Wednesday received a psychological boost during his road to recovery from a recent heart attack when SA Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan, local football administrators and representatives from one of his former top clubs, Kaizer Chiefs, visited him at his home in the Mount Edgecombe Country Club Estate, Durban. Tovey, a former Bafana Bafana captain and current Safa technical director, informed his guests and journalists in attendance that he was making reasonably good progress and, while rigorous activities might be excluded, he hoped to start playing a leisurely round of golf in his plush residential complex next week. He said he was very grateful for the visit, while Jordaan assured him that he only needed to focus on his health during his sick leave until January because his job would definitely be waiting for him.Picture: Motshwari Mofokeng
