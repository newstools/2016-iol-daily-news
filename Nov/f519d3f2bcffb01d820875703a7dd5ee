Durban - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) said it had interviewed the Point policeman accused of driving a stolen vehicle, and had dismissed any claims of corruption.Last week, Chumpawathie Rajpal, 64, of Tafta Lodge, claimed she had seen her stolen Nissan Sentra outside the Point police station.She claimed the car was hers and was being driven by a policeman, whom she confronted immediately, but with no joy.National spokesman for Ipid, Moses Dlamini, said Rajpaul reported that in June her Sentra had been stolen from outside her South Beach Avenue flat.The docket was transferred to the vehicle theft unit in Isipingo.In August, Rajpal reported to Ipid that she spotted her vehicle outside the police station.&#x201C;A file was registered with us on the understanding that there was a possibility of corruption in the recovery and possible re-registration of the vehicle.&#x201C;A National Traffic Information System computer printout was obtained and it confirmed that Rajpal&#x2019;s vehicle was still listed as stolen.&#x201C;The vehicle (number) she saw outside the station was registered to a Red Polo. We interviewed a policeman and he stated he never owned a Sentra but did own a Golf,&#x201D; he said.Dlamini said Ipid could not show police involvement or any corruption because the vehicle was never recovered nor re-registered.
