Durban - ANC leaders from provinces like Gauteng and the Eastern Cape were a &#x201C;bunch of losers&#x201D;, who should not expect to be elected on to the party&#x2019;s national executive committee, says the ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal.The provincial ANCYL was briefing the media in Durban on Thursday as it made its case for AU chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to succeed President Zuma when he steps down next year.Provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said Dlamini Zuma was the person to lead the revolution and unite the ruling party.&#x201C;This woman, the great mother of the nation, must take the reins of the ANC and bring everyone together to build a strong ANC,&#x201D; Sabelo said.The Daily News reported on Tuesday that three ANCYL regions had officially nominated Dlamini Zuma to become the first woman to lead the 104-year-old liberation movement.&#x201C;We want her to be surrounded with winners, people who lose municipalities can&#x2019;t lead the ANC,&#x201D; he said, referring to provincial structures which had lost metros in the August local government poll.&#x201C;We want only those that are winning because those who are winning are a clear indication our people have confidence in them,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;If you go to Free State they are a bunch of winners, if you go to Mpumalanga, they are a bunch of winners so those are the kinds of leaders we want to lead at national level,&#x201D; Sabelo added.Mpumalanga, Free State and North West, popularly known as the Premier League, are regarded as a powerful lobby group of provinces within the ANC.But, it was clear that Gauteng and the Eastern Cape have fallen out of favour with the league as Sabelo said the losing provinces should consolidate themselves after their election losses.&#x201C;The ones who are losing should stay within the provinces to concentrate on regaining lost ground,&#x201D; he said.
