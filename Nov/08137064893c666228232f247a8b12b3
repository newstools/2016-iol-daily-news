Johannesburg - Cosatu seems to be undergoing an ideological shift, with its new awakening aimed at reclaiming its might by coming down hard on the ANC and its government.It has read the ANC the riot act, listing its failures and leadership weaknesses that have workers frustrated.The federation on Thursday expressed displeasure with the government s continued rejection of their demands, the arrogance of some leaders and the party's disdain for workers.Labour analyst Mamokgethi Molopyane viewed Cosatu s stand as an indication the federation was moving in a different direction, as opposed to is usual meekness when dealing with the ANC or the government. For the first time in a long time we see Cosatu coming out harsh on matters that are linked to the president.&quot;It signifies a change of ideology and perhaps a realisation that with everything that is going on in the public space, we cannot be seen to be supporting that particular side. We are now going to see a Cosatu that is not going to hold anything back, she said.Workers were tired of being taken for granted, Cosatu said, pointing to the stalled National Health Insurance, the non-release of the promised Comprehensive Social Security Discussion Paper and the non-implementation of a decent legislated national minimum wage .Said Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla: Cosatu is equally tired of the ANC government s many failures and broken promises, and the condescension and arrogance of some ANC leaders who dismiss Cosatu and workers' legitimate demands as bargaining council matters. We are allied to the ANC because we have always understood it to be committed to the working-class issues.&quot;Aspirations of the working class have to be reflected in the ANC and its government, and if it rejects or dishonours those aspirations, it's turning its back on workers. The federation frowned upon the spending of taxpayers money on what it described as frivolous legal challenges and said some were sometimes abusing the legal processes to defend the indefensible.
