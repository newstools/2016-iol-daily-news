President Jacob Zuma s backers in the ANC have vowed to defend him until he finishes his term in office in 2019, despite growing calls inside and outside the party for him to go now.The state capture report was seen by those opposed to Zuma s leadership as the last straw, but the ANC Youth League, the Women s League and Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) on Thursday reaffirmed their support for Zuma and ensuring he completed his term in office.Independent analyst Professor Sipho Seepe also said it would be difficult to dislodge Zuma because the balance of forces in the ANC were in his favour.The support for Zuma came as Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe, who is also implicated in the state capture report, defended himself and said he would take Thuli Madonsela s report on a judicial review.He said he had done nothing wrong and did not support those calling for Zuma to go.He accused Madonsela of not giving him an opportunity to give his version on the prepayment of R570 million by Eskom to Tegeta for coal.ANCYL secretary-general Njabulo Nzuza said they would ensure Zuma completed his term as ANC president next year and of the country in 2019.He said Zuma had not been found guilty by the report and that it was inconclusive. The report is not a conclusive report; it does say so itself. All that it is raising are allegations that have not been proven and tested in a court of law. It becomes premature for people to grandstand and say President Zuma must go, said Nzuza.He said it was a matter of principle for them to defend Zuma as leader of the ANC.MKMVA national chair Kebby Maphatsoe said: There is nothing wrong that the president has done that can change our view in support of him. Those people speaking out day in and day out are hardening our attitude, making it difficult for us to listen. He insisted that Zuma would complete his term.Maphatsoe said Zuma had support from ANC branches and provinces.
