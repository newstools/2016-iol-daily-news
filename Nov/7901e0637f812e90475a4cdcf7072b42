Cape Town - It was another day of the fight for free education at Stellenbosch University (SU) on Wednesday when protesting students from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and the University of the Western Cape took their battle for education to SU.The protesting students marched to the university&#x2019;s education centre, with attempts to disrupt exams. They said there had been little #FeesMustFall action at the university.Management of SU, however, said it was still committed to completing the academic year. SU spokesman, Martin Viljoen, said they were aware of the protest action and that 70 students had convened on the campus.&#x201C;Information available to the University is that the largest part of the group were not from SU, but from other universities in the Western Cape.&quot;Just before the start of the afternoon exams, the group moved towards the Education Building and tried to gain access to the building. They were denied entry by the Public Order Police and security personnel.&quot;The group remained in front of the building for the largest part of the afternoon. A small number of SU students who were to write exams in the building were not able to access the building before it had to be locked.&quot;No further disruptions took place, but the University&#x2019;s contingency plans and security measures will remain in place for the duration of the exams,&#x201D; Viljoen said.He said the situation on campus will be closely monitored.Viljoen also said the University had &#x201C;made counsellors available to students who were in need of therapeutic support.In a recent survey, more than 93 percent of students taking part in the survey indicated they supported the university&#x2019;s initiatives to continue with the academic programme, Viljoen said.
