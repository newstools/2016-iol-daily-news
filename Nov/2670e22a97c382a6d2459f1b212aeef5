The Public Protector has since clarified that the Report was signed and finalised by the former Public Protector on 14 October 2016. The presidency added that Zuma had withdrawn his high court bid to stop the release of the report in the interests of justice and [a] speedy resolution of the matter .It added that all citizens had the right to fair and reasonable administrative justice and once the report was released Zuma would study it with care to see whether there was a need to return to the courts to ask that it be reviewed.
