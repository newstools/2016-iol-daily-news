Durban - President Jacob Zuma would have slept easily on Wednesday night after the release of the Public Protector&#x2019;s &#x201C;State of Capture&#x201D; report, say several commentators.Political and legal analysts said the report was rushed, incomplete and lacked factual evidence &#x2013; with one branding it a &#x201C;doubtful document&#x201D; and a &#x201C;list of allegations&#x201D;.The report, compiled by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, called for remedial action &#x2013; that a judicial commission of inquiry be established and its work completed in six months.Political commentator Professor Sipho Seepe said it was clearly &#x201C;not the final report&#x201D; and this was the reason Madonsela had called on Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to institute a commission of inquiry. He said this raised a question of law because it was only the president who had such powers.Law expert Professor Karthy Govender agreed the remedial action posed an &#x201C;interesting question of law&#x201D; because it was only the president who had the constitutional powers to do so.&#x201C;According to the constitution it is the responsibility of the president to appoint a judicial inquiry, but no one must have anticipated that the president would be directly implicated and perhaps that is why the public protector has asked the chief justice to appoint a judge, because the president cannot call an investigation on himself,&#x201D; he said.Govender said the question was whether it was &#x201C;appropriate&#x201D; for the president to appoint an inquiry on himself.He said Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas raised &#x201C;extremely serious&#x201D; allegations in the report that he had been offered the job of finance minister and a R600 000 bribe at the Gupta&#x2019;s Saxonworld home, but nothing was done about it by the president.Seepe said Madonsela did not trust her replacement in the public protector&#x2019;s office, Busi Mkhwebane, and said this was evident in how the investigation was &#x201C;rushed&#x201D;.&#x201C;There were no adverse findings and there appears to be nothing definitive about it (the report). Effectively if she had more time, she would have continued and done a thorough job,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;The president will definitely sleep better, because things are much more easier for him right now, this has bought him some time.&#x201C;But at the same time it also means now we have access to the information until the commission concludes its work,&#x201D; he said.Mzwanele Manyi, the leader of the Decolonisation Foundation, said the report was an &#x201C;anti-climax&#x201D; for those who were hoping for shocking revelations.He described it as a &#x201C;doubtful document&#x201D; and reduced it to a &#x201C;list of allegations&#x201D;.He said Madonsela erred in not giving adequate time to those implicated to respond to questions.&#x201C;It is flawed on so many levels, to call it a report is an overstatement, it is just a list of allegations bundled into a document. Those who were saying it is rushed have been proven a point, Thuli had a motive and she has undermined the incumbent (Mkhwebane) because we all thought it was an interim report that would allow for comments, but suddenly it was made final so that the incoming public protector would have nothing to do with it,&#x201D; he said.Manyi said there was &#x201C;nothing earth shattering&#x201D; in the report and defended Cogta Minister Des van Rooyen and Eskom head Brian Molefe&#x2019;s Gupta home visits and phone calls as &#x201C;not a crime&#x201D;.&#x201C;Van Rooyen is the treasurer of the MK, he could have been there to raise funds because the Guptas have lots of money. If you want to make a point about something, you do not stop at maybe or what ifs,&#x201D; he said.Manyi said the president had to take the report on review and said the report should be struck off. The president said he would &#x201C;give consideration to the contents of the report to ascertain whether it should be a subject of a court challenge&#x201D;.Lawyer Zehir Omar said Madonsela had failed to give the president adequate time to respond to the questions.He said there was a prevailing lack of trust in her successor.
