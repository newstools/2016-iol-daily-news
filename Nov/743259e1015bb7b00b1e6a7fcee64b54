by Sihle MlamboDurban - Applications for tuition and financial aid funding through the &#xAD;National Student Financial Aid Scheme have dwindled, but pupils from the missing middle &#x2013; fearing disappointment &#x2013; were applying for private bursaries instead.The deadline for pupils and students seeking funding aid for the 2017 academic year closes at the end of November, and the financial aid scheme&#x2019;s chief executive, Msulwa Daca, announced this week that applications for next year funding were &#x201C;very low&#x201D; since applications opened at the beginning of August.NSFAS had received just 195&#x2009;000 funding applications, while more than 800&#x2009;000 pupils were sitting for matric exams this month.In KwaZulu-Natal, the non-profit organisation, the Central Applications Office &#x2013; which &#xAD;handles applications for the universities &#x2013; said the overall picture showed that university applications in the province had increased compared with last year at the same period.Daca said NSFAS had received more applications from students in university than the more than 800000 full-time and part-time &#xAD;pupils sitting for exams this month.George van der Ross, CAO chief executive, said the number of applications at UKZN and DUT had increased by 5&#x2009;500 and 5&#x2009;200 respectively, compared with the same period last year.Van der Ross said 101&#x2009;057 applicants had indicated that they required financial aid funding in their CAO university applications, about 5&#x2009;000 more than last year.He said the CAO received more than 600&#x2009;000 applications from 140&#x2009;000 applicants this year so far, and said the application for university fees of R200 had been extended to the end of this week, after the DUT extended its applications from September to the end of October.A late fee of R400 kicks in for all applications from November 6, he said.But a snap survey among &#xAD;pupils at Ridge Park College on Wednesday, after their isiZulu Paper 1, showed that the pupils &#x2013; who generally come from homes which qualify as missing middle &#x2013; were not applying for financial aid.Deputy head girl Samantha Mfeka, 17, who plans to study physiotherapy at the University of Western Cape next year, said she was pinning her hopes on an academic and sports bursary.She has represented the district, province and South Africa in women&#x2019;s basketball, hockey, softball, volleyball and soccer throughout her high school days.Mfeka, the daughter of a nurse, said she had not applied for financial aid funding, and had targeted 4 distinctions in her finals &#x2013; for isiZulu, life sciences, geography and life orientation.Another pupil, Sthandiwe Mgobhozi, said her police woman mother had told her she was not allowed to apply for funding because she earned more than the R160&#x2009;000 per annum threshold.She has applied for bursaries from the Department of Health and a motor vehicle production company in KZN to study towards medical laboratory sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology.Speaking to the Daily News on Wednesday, Daca said they were urging all students to apply for funding &#x2013; including those whose parents were earning above the financial aid threshold.&#x201C;The missing middle can apply, because some of them do get funding, so we may cover some of them. The only difference is that there will be an expected family contribution from them while they receive the funding, so they have to pay something back,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;The missing middle should be making the applications to us, that is why we always urge all students to apply, because we never know when the money is going to run out,&#x201D; he said.
