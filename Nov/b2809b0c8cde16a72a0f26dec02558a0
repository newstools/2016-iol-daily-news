Durban - Africa is celebrating 50 years since the establishment of an ombudsman on the continent, but some countries were looking at closing ombuds offices after realising their power.This was one of the challenges facing the offices, it emerged at a meeting of 37 ombudsman and mediators from across the continent.They are in Durban for a four-day biennial general assembly of the African Ombudsman and Mediators Association (AOMA).The association is being hosted by the UKZN-based African Ombudsman Research Centre (AORC), whose chairwoman is Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.Speaking at a gala dinner, AOMA general secretary, Dr Otiende Amollo, said they were gathering at a time marked by prospects and challenges.&#x201C;We have challenges by some of our members and we will discuss that,&#x201D; Amollo said.&#x201C;We also have prospects in a sense of greater recognition so much that in some countries they are wondering is this an animal to shut up or close up because some people may have underestimated how powerful the ombudsman is until now,&#x201D; he said.Amollo also said the general assembly gave them an opportunity to discuss jurisdiction issues, among other things.&#x201C;It is our time to reflect on the past, the future and what kind of association we want going forward,&#x201D; he said.Also speaking at the occasion, UKZN deputy vice-chancellor, Prof John Mubangizi, said research he had done showed the biggest challenge facing the ombudsman institution was political interference as well as resource constraints.&#x201C;Despite the challenges, the fact remains that ombudsmen have played and continue to play an important role in promoting accountability and good governance,&#x201D; he said.Mubangizi, also board member of AORC, said the strength of ombudsmen was their independence that was constitutionally enshrined and supported by legislation.This, he said, was the bedrock upon which the ombudsman was anchored.In South Africa, the Office of the Public Protector has faced funding challenges with the government over the years because of inadequate budget allocation.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela has, over the years, appealed for more funds to conduct investigations that mainly related to maladministration in the public sector.However, Mkhwebane said South Africa had high regard for its ombudsmen.Recalling the country&#x2019;s relation to the institution back to the first decade of democracy, she said: &#x201C;The move showed the level of respect we as a country accord to the institution of ombudsmen.&#x201D;
