Parliament &#x2013; The Democratic Alliance (DA) made a renewed call on Wednesday for President Jacob Zuma to do the right thing and resign following the release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s report on state capture.&#x201C;Following the findings in this report, Jacob Zuma should do the honourable thing and resign,&#x201D; DA leader Mmusi Maimane said in a statement.&#x201C;Given the scale of the state capture that is detailed in the report, which he has allowed and indeed fostered, he cannot continue in office. The Zuma presidency has been a blight on South Africa &#x2013; only his resignation can help repair the damage he has caused.&#x201D;Madonsela found that Zuma may have breached the executive ethics code in several instances, including if proven that it is true, that the Gupta family knew last year that then finance minister Nhlanhla Nene would be removed from his post.&#x201C;The report finds evidence of significant wrongdoing, improper influence, conflicts of interest and outright corruption &#x2013; much of which is new information, and all of which points directly to President Zuma, Duduzane Zuma and the Guptas,&#x201D; Maimane said.&#x201C;The manner in which Jacob Zuma has conducted himself is completely dishonourable and unbecoming of the nation&#x2019;s President.&#x201D;If Zuma fails to resign, South Africa&#x2019;s biggest opposition party is set to table another motion of no confidence in Zuma in the next month.&#x201C;This report gives additional weight to this motion of no confidence, and there is no reasonable excuse for the ANC in Parliament to reject this motion in support of Jacob Zuma.&#x201D;Maimane also welcomed Madonsela&#x2019;s directive that the President appoint a commission of inquiry, headed by a judge to be chosen by the Chief Justice, to probe possible breaches of the executive ethics code by Zuma and members of his cabinet.
