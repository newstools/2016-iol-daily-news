Durban - The South African Women s Forte (SAWF) raised R300 000 to build a cerebral palsy ward at the KwaZulu-Natal Children s Hospital and on Wednesday handed over the further R300 000 at the opening of the ward. The SAWF, an NGO established to empower SA women in business, started fundraising last year. We focus on violence against women and children, poverty relief, and the aged. Every year we allow people from different charities to conduct presentations and we then decide which one to support. The KZN Children s Hospital was among the charities. said SAWF president, Michelle Micheal. Rita Abrahams, CEO and founder of the KZN Children s Hospital Trust, said this ward would make a huge difference. We did not have much space for the children to do their therapy. We were functioning in one room with their care givers, said Abrahams. Daily News
