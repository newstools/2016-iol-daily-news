New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has refused to accede to the demands of the official opposition to release the report on state capture.Mkhwebane on Wednesday told MPs she would make the report public only after all court processes had been finalised.She said the report was kept under lock and key in her office in spite of demands from some of the opposition parties to release it.The new public protector told MPs she would on Friday file her responding affidavit in the high court in Pretoria against the interdict of President Jacob Zuma and Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen.She also assured members of the justice and correctional services committee that state capture was a priority.&#x201C;My vision is at the grassroots level. Contrary to popular belief, it does not mean I will give high-profile cases less attention,&#x201D; said Mkhwebane.She did not commit to a date of the release of the report on state capture, but said&#x2028;she would file an affidavit on Friday.She was supported by the EFF, who said the report must be kept safe until the court applications have been dealt with in November.EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu said all parties were unanimous that the report be kept safe, but be made public once court processes were finalised.&#x201C;There is unanimity because the ANC issued a statement that the report must be released,&#x201D; said Shivambu.Werner Horn of the DA said that as the report was final, Mkhwebane had to make it public.He said the Public Protector Act called on the public protector to give the complainant, in this case the DA, a copy of the report once it has been completed.But Mkhwebane said she could not do this as she had to prepare affidavits in the case against Zuma and Van Rooyen.The ANC Women&#x2019;s League entered the fray on Wednesday and called on Mkhwebane not to be intimidated by the DA.Zuma and Van Rooyen complained in their court papers they were not given a chance by Madonsela to respond.ACDP MP Steve Swart said he was happy that ANC MP and chairman of the committee Mathole Motshekga had raised the issue of the courts in his remarks to Mkhwebane.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m happy you say the courts must be the last resort, I hope you mention that to President Jacob Zuma,&#x201D; said Swart.He said the Office of the Public Protector was faced with 18 challenges in the high court by politicians and officials in entities challenging the public protector&#x2019;s findings.Swart said among the frivolous court applications were the SABC on Hlaudi Motsoeneng and Zuma.He said Mkhwebane must ask for cost orders against officials and Zuma for their frivolous applications.
