Durban - Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife has fallen victim to an old scam, leaving it R122&#x2009;000 out of pocket.This was after conmen, who purported to represent a company doing business with the entity, swindled it into making payments into their bank account.The scam, revealed at the legislature this week, has infuriated the lawmakers, who now want action taken against the official who transferred the payment, as well as the recovery of the money.According to chief financial officer, Darius Chitate, an official at the entity received written correspondence requesting it to change the banking details of a service provider.Chitate said the documents had appeared so genuine that the junior official, who was newly-appointed after working as an intern, processed it without noticing they were fraudulent.&#x201C;It (appeared) genuine. Nigerians usually do it,&#x201D; he said.He said it would have been unfair to discipline the junior official.&#x201C;It was not deliberate. It was interpreted as a genuine document.&#x201D;Chitate also said when a payment was made to the changed bank account, the account was closed &#x2013; and efforts to recover the money failed.&#x201C;We went to the bank to see if we could recover the funds, but we were not able to. The money was gone. The account closed. We could not do much to recover the amount,&#x201D; he said.However, Chitate said they had put measures in place to prevent similar scams in the future.But the lawmakers would hear none of his explanations.ANC MPL Vusi Dube said it was shocking that it had been business as usual when Ezemvelo took no action after the scam.&#x201C;If we have something like this, what is the possibility of this not happening again?&#x201D; Dube asked.The NFP&#x2019;s Erickson Zungu said: &#x201C;If you get a letter notifying you about changing banking details, surely before you act on that, there are things you need to do to check if this is not a bogus letter, because there are monies involved,&#x201D; Zungu said.&#x201C;This money must be recovered in one way or the other. (To say it was) paid to a wrong account is unacceptable. There must be steps taken to recover the money,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;We should be taking extra care of taxpayers&#x2019; money,&#x201D; he added.ANC MPL Sipho Nkosi questioned why the service provider was not contacted to check the request to change the banking account.Ezemvelo board chairman, Comfort Ngidi, said the scam had been reported to the police and the implicated official had taken adequate steps before changing the bank account.However, Ngidi said should the police probe uncover complicity, action would be taken.
