Durban - Despite being close to clinching a clean audit, the KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development, Environment, Tourism and Environmental Affairs Department has been flagged for &#xAD;several irregular payments.On Wednesday, one lawmaker even compared the department to an athlete who, in the final stages of a race, would play to the spectators, only to lose it.The official opposition even offered words of encouragement to the department, saying it should pull up its socks so that it was not again called to account for its finances at the standing committee on public accounts next financial year.This, as the auditor-general found the department to have not taken effective steps to prevent irregular expenditure totalling R12.8 million.Some of the department&#x2019;s employees were found to have not signed their performance agreements, the AG said.&#x201C;A clean audit should be within reach of the department,&#x201D; DA MPL Mark Steele told the department&#x2019;s delegation, led by MEC Sihle Zikalala.Steele said the department&#x2019;s slow response to addressing irregular expenditure was a stumbling block.ANC MPL Sipho Nkosi complimented the department for not incurring wasteful and fruitless expenditure, but did not hide his disappointment that the department had failed to honour its commitment to get a clean audit. Nkosi noted that the department had reduced its irregular expenditure from R70m.&#x201C;We hope you are to give specific information on action against responsible officials. We can&#x2019;t talk about irregular expenditure as if the Public Finance Management Act is a new piece of legislation.Nkosi noted that the department had R6.9m in unauthorised expenditure.Explaining some of the expenditure, chief finance officer Noluthando Mngadi said although R12.7m in irregular expenditure was incurred, R8.8m was for transaction or contracts relating to prior years.Only R3.7m in irregular expenditure related to 2015-16 and related to awarding a tender without tax clearance.
