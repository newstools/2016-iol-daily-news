by Lutho PasiyaDurban - Drummer Joe Fynn is set to embark on a community upliftment project which he hopes will help the children of Wentworth end the scourge of drug abuse in the south Durban community.The 67-year-old, who grew up in Wentworth, hopes music will inspire the youth to turn their backs on a life of drugs and crime, which has gripped many in the community in a vicious cycle.&#x201C;When I took a tour in Wentworth and saw young children doing drugs and the high level of teenage pregnancy, I thought of opening a music school, which I believe will be a hobby that will take them off the streets and from doing the wrong things. I want to take them out of that life through music,&#x201D; he said.The well-known drummer, who holds the South African record for drumming for four days in row, started playing drums when he was eight years old, and currently teaches music at his academy in Cape Town, Joe&#x2019;s Drum Academy.He attended the college of music at the University of Cape Town.Fynn raised funds for Cansa&#x2019;s Eikenhof Care Home, an NGO which has served as a care facility for cancer patients by playing for 24 hours in memory of his wife, Bridget, who died of breast cancer.He hopes to do the same in Durban for the music school that he will be opening.&#x201C;I plead for business guys from around Wentworth to get involved and have an input in this project, and to also give a helping hand when it comes to fundraising and equipment, like instruments,&#x201D; said Fynn.He said the school would not only focus on drums, but also on other instruments and different dance cultures.&#x201C;The focus is not only on drums; we need people who will teach guitar (bass and electric), saxophone and different types of dances, from hip-hop, Zulu dance and ballet dance,&#x201D; he said. The school is set to open early next year at the Interfellowship Global Ministries in Wentworth, accommodating children from the age of five upwards.
