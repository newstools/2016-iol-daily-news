Durban - Nearly one in six KwaZulu-Natal pupils preparing for matric exams, beginning on Monday, are progressed pupils, and to ease the burden on these strugglers, some will write some of their papers in June next year.The Department of Basic Education hopes that its introduction of two exam periods will give the the province&#x2019;s 28&#x2009;000 progressed pupils a better chance of passing.The department&#x2019;s national director-general, Mathanzima Mweli, defended the progressed pupil policy and said there had always been something like it in South Africa, but in the past it was known as condonation.Mweli said the policy had been strengthened but did not amount to automatic progression.Dr Rufus Poliah, director for national assessments, said according to the new criteria, the pupil must pass their first language paper; must attend school regularly, including not being absent for more than 20 days; must have complied with school-based assessments; and must pass four of the seven subjects.But Poliah was concerned by the sharp increase in numbers for progressed pupils in 2016 &#x2013; up 38&#x2009;000 on last year&#x2019;s national figure 65&#x2009;673 to 104&#x2009;136.&#x201C;We are concerned about the high numbers (of progressed pupils) KZN (28&#x2009;036) and Limpopo (17&#x2009;000),&#x201D; he said.KZN has about 170&#x2009;000 matric candidates.&#x201C;Our better performing provinces have seen progressed learners decrease, which is good because fewer learners are being progressed.&#x201C;With the three stream education model, some of those pupils should not be in the academic stream, they should be in the technical or vocational stream.&#x201C;The progression model is an interim measure to assist learners who have become frustrated, demoralised and become delinquents. Progression is not a pass-one-pass-all system. The important point is to help learners pass, whether it takes one or two years,&#x201D; he said.On writing the exams in November and completing them in June, Poliah said the new policy was being reserved for progressed pupils.&#x201C;Only progressed learners should be given an option not to write in one sitting. If a progressed learner performed well, there is no reason to be held back.&#x201C;We only make the decision only after having written the preparation exam,&#x201D; he said.Poliah said progressed pupils who qualified for multiple exam writing were those who had failed more than three subjects.Exams for subjects they had failed during the trial papers would be delayed and written in June the following year. A preliminary matric certificate with the available four subjects would be issued in January with the rest of the pupils.Once the pupil has written and completed their exams in June, a combined matric certificate would be re-issued later that year.
