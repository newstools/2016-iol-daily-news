Durban - Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife was given a dressing down by the KwaZulu-Natal legislature for not taking to heart the findings of the auditor-general (AG) over its failure to come up with a plan to fix its audit shortcomings.Maggie Govender, chairwoman of the standing committee of public accounts, did not mince her words when expressing the committee&#x2019;s &#xAD;displeasure at the conduct of the public entity.&#x201C;This is not acceptable. It&#x2019;s either you are not taking the AG&#x2019;s findings seriously, or you are not doing your job,&#x201D; &#xAD;Govender said.&#x201C;When we see you in Feb&#xAD;ruary, we expect something &#xAD;better&#x2026; This is really unacceptable,&#x201D; she said.The public entity received an unqualified audit opinion with findings on compliance issues in the 2015-16 financial year.Apart from being swindled out of R122&#x2009;000 (see adjoining report), AG Kimi Makwetu found &#xAD;material misstatements in the entity&#x2019;s financial statements submitted for audit.Makwetu also found inadequate measures within the supply chain to prevent &#xAD;irregular expenditure and wasteful expenditure.Scopa heard that the entity had incurred R252 000 in fruitless and wasteful expenditure, as well as more than R11&#x2009;million in irregular expenditure.The entity had also failed to advertise construction tenders on the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) website, and in the Government Gazette.However, the document signed by chief executive officer David Mabunda and presented by the chief finance officer, showed that most action plans had time frames for implementation in March 2017.Govender said it raised a concern how the entity would address the audit failures if they were only to be acted on the following year.&#x201C;We, as Scopa, can&#x2019;t accept this kind of a thing. You put a plan to eliminate findings,&#x201D; she said.ANC MPL Sipho Nkosi was equally disappointed that the entity did not make a presentation on how it planned to tackle irregular expenditure.&#x201C;In the beginning of the year, chair of the entity and chief executive, we want to get a report how many people were held responsible for incurring irregular expenditure &#x2013; and action taken against them,&#x201D; Nkosi said.He also said the same was expected on the R252&#x2009;000 in wasteful and fruitless expenditure.&#x201C;We won&#x2019;t allow our people to be short-changed R252&#x2009;000 in one year,&#x201D; he said, adding that the amount had in the past tripled. &#x201C;We said not even a cent of our people&#x2019;s money should go to fruitless expenditure,&#x201D; Nkosi said.NFP MPL Erickson Zungu said it was unacceptable that the adverts for construction were not advertised on the CIDB and government websites because that procedure was not known by their supply chain unit.&#x201C;It tells us that some people were trying to prohibit the rest not to tender for these projects by simply not adhering to the basic rules,&#x201D; Zungu said.He said these were basic things the supply chain officials ought to know about their job.&#x201C;It means one thing &#x2013; action should be taken against these people because this can&#x2019;t be allowed. This is unacceptable,&#x201D; Zungu said.However, Mabunda said the entity had taken action against its officials found to be in the wrong, but some resigned when there were investigations.&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know why they resign... There are a number of investigations undertaken by our internal audit unit,&#x201D; he said.Mabunda also said irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure were taken seriously.&#x201C;We do take action and we follow up on people. Maybe, we (should) do a report on the cases,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;Where money is recoverable, there will be no excuse not to recover the money,&#x201D; Mabunda said.He added that the entity&#x2019;s supply chain unit was in the process of being rebuilt.
