Johannesburg - The ANC Women&#x2019;s League has dismissed advocate Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s investigation into state capture by President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s close associates the Guptas.The league said the yet-to-be released report advanced white supremacy and politically hindered the non-racial society.The report was hastily compiled, narrow and politically motivated, it added.Zuma lodged a court interdict last week to prevent Madonsela, the former public protector, from making her final report public. His application will be heard on November 1, together with that of Des van Rooyen, the minister of co-operative governance and traditional affairs.ANCWL secretary-general Meokgo Matuba called on Madonsela&#x2019;s successor, advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, to conduct a full investigation into state capture which included the CIEX report.The report pertained to an investigation in 1997 by CIEX, a UK-based company which had reportedly secured a contract from the government to investigate apartheid looting.It claimed to have identified about R26&#x2005;billion that was stolen, laundered or held offshore by apartheid-era bankers and senior politicians, among others, and said the funds could be retrieved, but its contract was later terminated.The ANCWL also wanted Mkhwebane&#x2019;s state capture investigation to focus on the &#x201C;probable&#x201D; maladministration and corruption between Transnet and Anglo American&#x2019;s subsidiary Kumba Resources.The former related to a 23-year contract signed by the parties during Maria Ramos&#x2019;s tenure as group chief executive of Transnet.The contract, signed in 2005, was for the &#x201C;transport and handling of iron ore&#x201D; from the Northern Cape through the Sishen-Saldanha export channel, according to Transnet.EFF leader Julius Malema has said the party would take Mkhwebane&#x2019;s appointment as public protector on a judicial review if they were unhappy with her conduct. He said they had voted for Mkhwebane knowing there were allegations that she was a spy. @luyolomkentane
