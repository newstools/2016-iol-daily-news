Newly-appointed Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has appealed for additional funding of about R100 million next year to beef up the work of her office and hire forensic auditors, new investigators and quality assurers.In her first appearance in Parliament, Mkhwebane told MPs on Wednesday the extra funds would bolster the work of her office.She said the budget of R263m allocated to her office was little compared to the enormous and complex investigations they were doing.For 2017/18 her office would need an extra R71m, in the 2018/19 financial year they would require an additional R82m and in 2019/20 the office would need R87m.Former public protector, Thuli Madonsela, had made a similar request to MPs for years, until she left office last Friday.But MPs across parties told Mkhwebane they supported her in getting extra funding from the National Treasury.ACDP MP Steve Swart said they had had similar discussions with Madonsela, and he urged fellow members of the justice committee to support Mkhwebane&#x2019;s request.Swart said Parliament now had the powers to amend the budget, and this could be done through the Money Bills Act, to help Mkhwebane.Sibusiso Mncwabe, of the National Freedom Party, said the committee must not think twice in supporting the office of the public protector.&#x201C;As a committee and Parliament, we must do our best to fully fund this office, because we cannot allow international donors,&#x201D; he said.This was after concerns were raised by MPs that USAID and German development programme GIZ had funded the public protector.Mkhwebane said she would put a stop to international donor funding.In the presentation to the committee Mkhwebane said international donors gave the office $500 000 (R7 million) last year. But she said this would come to an end as it could compromise her office.Mkhwebane also told MPs she would not agree to the request of the official opposition to make public the report on state capture. She said the report was in her office, but she would not make it public because it was sub judice.Mkhwebane said she would file her responding affidavit in the Pretoria High Court on Friday against the interdict of President Zuma to block the release of the report.The matter will be heard in the High Court on November 1.Mkhwebane said she would release the report after the court processes.
