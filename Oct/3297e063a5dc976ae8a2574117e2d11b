The Department of Justice has revived the controversial Traditional Courts Bill, hoping to get it back in Parliament in the next few months.The bill has been sent to a cabinet subcommittee where it will be discussed before it is served before a full cabinet.Officials of the department had indicated that the bill was progressive and not bad, as had been believed. Some ANC ministers and civil society had objected to the bill, saying it was oppressive to women.They said it would give traditional leaders more powers and continue to oppress women in rural areas.The Department of Justice intends to get it back on the agenda in Parliament by the end of the year.November could be a critical month for the bill to get cabinet approval before it is sent to Parliament.The bill lapsed in Parliament after there was no agreement on it.Not all provinces in the National Council of Provinces backed the bill when it was referred to that House a few months ago.Some objected to the technical areas of the bill while others rejected it outright.When it is brought back to Parliament, the National Assembly will deal with it before it is sent to the National Council of Provinces for concurrence.This is not the first bill to be shelved by Parliament and later resuscitated.The Expropriation Bill was withdrawn in Parliament by then public works minister Thoko Didiza in 2008.This was after constitutional issues were raised around the bill. However, it was returned to Parliament by the department early this year, and was approved.However, the bill is still sitting in President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s office after objections were raised against his signing it into law. The bill calls for the expropriation of land for a public purpose or in the public interest.The revival of the Traditional Courts Bill followed consultation processes by the Department of Justice. When the bill is tabled in Parliament and discussed, the justice committee will conduct public hearings on the bill.In the last public hearings in the National Council of Provinces, women&#x2019;s rights groups and farming communities rejected the Traditional Courts Bill. They said it pre-dated democracy and needed to be shelved or thrown out.Those opposing it said it must be redrafted to ensure the protection of women against traditional leaders. It must also empower women in rural communities.
