Durban - As Durban embraces the Smart People&#x2019;s Port concept, which is also being embraced internationally, a word of caution has been sounded that they should not be isolated, but be able to share information with other ports.This warning was given this week at the African Ports Evolution, which is being held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Convention Centre.And it comes as Transnet National Ports Authority&#x2019;s Ristha Joga said the port had just completed a three-month &#x201C;proof of concept&#x201D; trial.The aim is to make a large amount of the port&#x2019;s operations wireless,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;A Smart People&#x2019;s Port will result in an efficient, data-rich and information-rich eco-system connecting port assets, port employees, terminal operators and port community, including road and rail,&#x201D; she said.A mobile application was one of the initiatives introduced to communicate with stakeholders like haulers and government, Joga said.The app could also be used to make complaints and deal with operational issues. The data would be used to improve port operations, she said.Ray Schraff, of the International Association of Ports and Harbours, said ports could no longer operate in isolation, and this included smartports.Being able to share information was important in ensuring goods moving efficiently through ports.Schraff said the use of a single system that would minimise the need to repeatedly enter the same information at the various ports was the way of the future. He said if governments and business shared the same information, movement of goods could go much faster.Schraff, who is advocating the dematerialisation of the operation of ports &#x2013; which is essentially removing paperwork &#x2013; said it was a matter of time before regions that joined the integrated window would take business away from regions that did not use it.In response, Joga said: &#x201C;While that may be possible, when one tries to imagine it, the current situation depicts too much competition. Terminal operators are competing for commodities and commodity volumes. For them to agree to transparency, it means they would reduce competitiveness among one another. I don&#x2019;t think they would be willing to do that at this point. Perhaps the environment is not mature enough.&#x201D;She said from a port authority perspective, they could agree to operate from a single platform, which could help them plan better and use resources better. However the commercial environment was not yet ready.
