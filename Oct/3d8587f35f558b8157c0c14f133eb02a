Durban - An application by the State to have individual photographs taken of 13 University of KwaZulu-Natal students facing charges, including public violence and assault, was declined on Wednesday.The students, aged between 18 and 27, were arrested early this year after more than 1&#x2009;000 students gathered at UKZN&#x2019;s Howard College campus, with many rampaging through the university, disrupting lectures.According to the State, university security tried to contain the situation and the police were also called in.Students were told about a court order restraining them from public violence at the university.After calls for the students to leave failed, the police tried to disperse the crowd and students responded by hurling bottles and stones, the State said.This led to the arrest of the 13.They face several charges, including assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, public violence and failure to comply with a court order.Acting magistrate, Naresh Bhikha, had released each of the students on R200 bail, reprimanding them for disrespecting state property.On Wednesday, the State made an application for each of the students to be photographed to help with investigations.The defence objected and the magistrate ruled against the application, arguing the court could not help with the State&#x2019;s investigation.The 13 students, all men, are: Siphamandla Khwela, Thabiso Nhlengeshwa, Lwandile Shongwe, Michael Khumalo, Sibongamandla Mavimbela, Wamkelwe Maqaqa, Eketsang Diaho, Thamsanqa Sibiya, Mbongeleni Ngcobo, Skumbuzo Nogese, Khulekani Makhathini, Lucas Mokoena and Andile Khumalo.They are to due back in court in January.Meanwhile, advocacy group Equal Education has called on Judge Presidents to meet magistrates handling #FeesMustFall cases to discuss ways to handle the cases appropriately.Equal Education deputy secretary, Ntuthuzo Ndzomo, said they noticed a &#x201C;pattern&#x201D; where students were denied bail in the lower courts.The education lobby group said it was of concern that nearly 600 students had been arrested during the #FeesMustFall protests.&#x201C;At a time when South Africa is asking itself difficult questions on how to create an equal, just, and decolonised society, lower courts continue where the apartheid courts left off,&#x201D; said Ndzomo.&#x201C;We appeal to the Judge Presidents of all provinces to urgently convene a meeting with all magistrates who will be overseeing #FeesMustFall matters, to agree on how to appropriately handle these cases. A test had to be postponed after fire crackers were set off at an exam venue at UKZN&#x2019;s Pietermaritzburg campus, yesterday.University spokesman, Lesiba Seshoka, said there were two reports of fire crackers being set off &#x2013; one at the student union hall where a test was taking place, and another at the William O&#x2019;Brien residence.
