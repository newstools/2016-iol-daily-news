Durban - After almost two years and R1.097-million worth of facelifts to 12 of 15 disused ministerial houses in Ulundi, more money is to be spent on another revamp to accommodate Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini&#x2019;s guests and provincial health doctors working in the Zululand district.The provincial government confirmed the refurbishments.&#x201C;The houses are currently being refurbished by the Department of Health before occupation takes place,&#x201D; Public Works Department spokesman, Mbulelo Baloyi, said.The Health Department had not responded to e-mailed questions sent to its communication unit on Monday.The Daily News understands that the disused houses had been vandalised while unused.&#x201C;There is an issue of damage and property that has been stolen from the houses,&#x201D; a source said.The renovation happened after a request by the king to be allocated at least three houses for use by his guests.The Daily News reported earlier this week that the king made the request to the provincial government earlier this year, at a meeting where he had also raised other issues.But instead of the legislature being apprised on the resolution of all the issues the monarch had raised, civil servants reported to the legislature that three houses had been allocated to the royal family.This was later confirmed by the Public Works Department.But lawmakers want a comprehensive report, including the cost implications, on the three allocated houses as well as who would be liable for their maintenance and other issues raised by the monarch.Nonhlanhla Khoza, chairwoman for committee at the Office of the Premier, said this week the proposed use of the houses for royal guests was a good idea that could minimise vandalism.&#x201C;I would like to think that many are vandalised for no good reason,&#x201D; she said.In a dramatic twist this week, it emerged that six doctors from the Health Department working in the Zululand district had taken occupation of some of the ministerial houses.The doctors were meant to have moved in six months ago, at the start of the financial year, as a way to attract scarce skills in the rural areas.The public and health departments had entered into a service-level agreement a year ago, subject to the lapse of lease agreements the latter had with privately owned houses.Commenting on the doctors&#x2019; occupation of the ministerial houses, Baloyi said the six doctors who had moved in had previously been using park homes in hospitals.&#x201C;The doctors are currently accommodated at facilities like the nurses homes, which are not suitable,&#x201D; he said earlier.The official opposition has said the turn of events spoke exactly to their request for a comprehensive report from the provincial government on the ministerial houses in light of Health Department and royal family wanting to utilise them.&#x201C;It is clear there are gaps of information to be provided to the portfolio committee so that it can take an informed decision,&#x201D; said DA MPL Sizwe Mchunu.Key to this, Mchunu said, were the financial implications involved in the process.&#x201C;It is important that we know the state of the properties, because renovations and refurbishments were done two years ago,&#x201D; he said.
