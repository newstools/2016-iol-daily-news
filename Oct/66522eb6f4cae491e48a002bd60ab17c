In the video the friend repeatedly says &#x201C;What happened Keegan?&#x201D; but many online have shortened to the phrase to the way they believe he pronounces it, &#x201C;Warrapen Keegan&#x201D;.Later in the video, the person filming the fight, gets so distracted by what is happening only after does he realise that he was standing on the embers.Many memes have since erupted commenting on the situation.IOL Mojo
