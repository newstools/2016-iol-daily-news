Cape Town - A student, in court for setting fire to a security office with two officers trapped inside, was released on R3&#x2005;000 bail on Thursday.Byron Dick, 26, appeared in the Bellville District Court before magistrate Ronald Rickerts.He is a student at the Bellville campus of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and is alleged to have been involved in two recent blazes on the campus.Dick said he had only R1&#x2005;500, and defence advocate Carlos Langeveldt told the court that Dick&#x2019;s parents had come from Joburg for the case, and R1 500 was all they could afford.The lawyer said the father had recently been retrenched, and the family had to survive on the mother&#x2019;s R4&#x2005;000 monthly salary.The parents still had to return to Johannesburg, he said, and reminded the court that the purpose of bail was to secure an accused person&#x2019;s attendance at his or her trial, not to punish.However, the magistrate said the amount had to be commensurate with the gravity of the charges &#x2013; public violence, arson, two counts of attempted murder and a violation of a high court order, granted during student unrest last year.He said the alleged offences were categorised under schedule 5 of the Bail Act, which placed an onus on Dick to persuade the court that his release was in the interests of justice.The bail application was not opposed by prosecutor Stefans Venter, who said Dick had no previous convictions, outstanding warrants for his arrest or pending criminal cases.The magistrate said the amount was the same as set on Wednesday for 12 students charged with public violence.If a student applied for admission to tertiary education, it meant the student was intelligent, the magistrate told Dick.He added: &#x201C;Such a person can decide what is right or wrong.&#x201D;He said the court&#x2019;s broad duty was to ensure these heinous offences were not committed by someone who did not respect the country&#x2019;s freedom.He added: &#x201C;If that&apos;s the course that these people choose, it is the court&#x2019;s duty to ensure our legacy is not destroyed. Freedom must be obtained through education, not the destruction of property.&#x201C;If these are people who want to destroy property, the courts must act to stop it immediately.&#x201D;The magistrate said the court had unique powers to decide what amount of bail was reasonable, but would not readily interfere with the prosecutor&#x2019;s recommendation. The prosecutor was in charge of all prosecutions, he said.Among the bail conditions was one banning Dick from leaving the Western Cape without permission from the investigating officer.Rickerts warned him: &#x201C;This means if you want to visit your parents in Joburg, you first get permission from the investigating officer.&#x201D;He cautioned Dick that if he breached any of the conditions, his bail would be revoked, he would be rearrested &#x201C;and you will not get bail again from any court in this country&#x201D;.On the attempted murder charges, Dick is alleged to have set the campus security office alight with a petrol bomb and to have locked two security guards in the burning office. The guards were rescued and rushed to hospital.The public violence charge accuses Dick of petrol-bombing first the university&#x2019;s administration building and then the security office. On the arson charge, he is alleged to have set the two buildings alight.The final charge alleges he ignored a high court order banning anyone doing anything illegal on campus &#x2013; issued after an urgent application last year to curb student unrest.
