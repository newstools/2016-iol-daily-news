Durban - One of the provincial high schools faced with social ills, including pregnancy, has been applauded for the improvements it has made to rectify the problems since last year.During her visit to Khabazela Secondary in Hillcrest on Wednesday, the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature Speaker, Lydia Johnson, complimented the school for the improvements it had made. Her visit was a follow-up to previous ones in January and June.She said the school had 32 pregnancies last year, while the performance of the pupils had been in decline for years. The root of the problem was ill-discipline, overcrowding and poor infrastructure.However, this year, the school registered only seven new pregnancies, said Johnson.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m very happy with the improvement in all fronts. This is an indication that the governing body (SGB) is working hand-in-hand with the school principal,&#x201D; she said.Sthembiso Mngadi, SGB chairman, said the school was able to get support from the parents to improve. School principal Zamani Jali said he was pleased with the pregnancy decrease.&#x201C;We have done quite well on that front. This year I want to promise that our pass rate will increase by 10% compared with last year&#x2019;s,&#x201D; he said.Johnson wished the school the best for the final exams.
